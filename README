this module is a basic auth provider for apache that forwards the auth requests
to a given url.



INSTALLATION:

* using apxs2 (this is apache's module helper utility,
               you probably want this if you've installed apache from source):

$ make -f
# make -f install



USAGE:

# don't forget to load the module if necessary (LoadModule ...)

# BasicAuth required
AuthType Basic
AuthName "REST based authentication"

Require valid-user

# use the module for basic authentication
AuthBasicProvider restauth

# the url of the rest authentication provider
RestAuthAddress http://localhost:5000/
# requests will look like this: POST RestAuthAddress/users/<user>/
# with password=<pass> as POST data

# optionally, authentication data for the provider
# (so you can authenticate as a certain service)
RestAuthUser mysite
RestAuthPassword mysitepassword
# RestAuthAddress URLs will be accessed with Basic authentication
# using the given credentials. in the example, this is the same as
# setting RestAuthAddress to http://mysite:mysitepassword@localhost:5000/

# optionally, a group the user must belong to
RestAuthGroup admins
# an additional request will be dispatched:
# GET RestAuthAddress/groups/<group>/<user>/

# whether to forward the client's ip address:
# POST: password=<password>&ip=<ip> is sent as the POST data
#
# defaults to off
RestAuthForwardIP off
