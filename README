This module is a Basic authentication and authorization provider for Apache that
forwards the auth requests to a RestAuth service specified by a given URL.

For the RestAuth specification the server must implement see:
https://restauth.net/Specification



INSTALLATION:

* Using apxs2 (this is Apache's module helper utility,
               you probably want this if you've installed Apache from source):

$ make -f
# make -f install



USAGE:

# Don't forget to load the module if necessary (LoadModule ...)

# Basic Authentication required
AuthType Basic
AuthName "REST based authentication"


# Who to authorize. This can be either a mod_authz_user line ("user" or "valid-user")
# or "restauth-group <group>" (allows users from the specified RestAuth group).
Require valid-user

# If "restauth-group" authorization is required, an additional request will be dispatched:
# GET RestAuthAddress/groups/<group>/users/<user>/
# The response code from the server must be in the 200-299 range (incl.)
# if the user/password combination is correct, or 404 if it is not.
# Other response codes will be treated as errors and propagate to the
# user.


# Use the module for Basic Authentication
AuthBasicProvider restauth


# The URL of the RestAuth provider:
RestAuthAddress http://localhost:5000/

# Requests will look like this: POST RestAuthAddress/users/<user>/
# with "password=<pass>" as POST data
# 
# The response code from the server must be in the 200-299 range (incl.)
# if the user/password combination is correct, or 404 if it is not.
# Other response codes will be treated as errors and propagate to the
# user.


# Optionally, authentication data for the provider (so you can authenticate
# as a certain service according to the RestAuth specification)
RestAuthServiceUser mysite
RestAuthServicePassword mysitepassword

# RestAuthAddress URLs will be accessed with Basic authentication
# using the given credentials. In the example, this is the same as
# setting RestAuthAddress to http://mysite:mysitepassword@localhost:5000/


# Optionally, if the connection to the provider is done via SSL and you
# don't want to check the certificate, set this to off.
# (N.B. ideally, you should create a self-signed certificate and trust
# it on the RestAuth server instead of using this option).
#
# Defaults to "on"
RestAuthServiceValidateCertificate on


# whether to forward the client's ip address:
# "password=<password>&ip=<ip>" is sent as POST data
#
# Defaults to "off"
RestAuthForwardIP off
