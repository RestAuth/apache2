this module is a Basic auth provider for apache that forwards the auth requests
to a RestAuth service specified by a given URL.

for the RestAuth specification the server must implement see:
http://fs.fsinf.at/wiki/RestAuth/Specification

INSTALLATION:

* using apxs2 (this is apache's module helper utility,
               you probably want this if you've installed apache from source):

$ make -f
# make -f install



USAGE:

# don't forget to load the module if necessary (LoadModule ...)

# BasicAuth required
AuthType Basic
AuthName "REST based authentication"

Require valid-user

# use the module for Basic authentication
AuthBasicProvider restauth

# the URL of the RestAuth provider
RestAuthAddress http://localhost:5000/
# requests will look like this: POST RestAuthAddress/users/<user>/
# with "password=<pass>" as POST data
# 
# the response code from the server must be in the 200-299 range (incl.)
# if the user/password combination is correct, or 404 if it is not.
# other response codes will be treated as errors and propagate to the
# user.

# optionally, authentication data for the provider
# (so you can authenticate as a certain service according to the 
# RestAuth specification)
RestAuthServiceUser mysite
RestAuthServicePassword mysitepassword
# RestAuthAddress URLs will be accessed with Basic authentication
# using the given credentials. in the example, this is the same as
# setting RestAuthAddress to http://mysite:mysitepassword@localhost:5000/

# optionally, a group the user must belong to
RestAuthGroup admins
# an additional request will be dispatched:
# GET RestAuthAddress/groups/<group>/users/<user>/
# the response code from the server must be in the 200-299 range (incl.)
# if the user/password combination is correct, or 404 if it is not.
# other response codes will be treated as errors and propagateto the
# user.

# whether to forward the client's ip address:
# "password=<password>&ip=<ip>" is sent as POST data
#
# defaults to off
RestAuthForwardIP off
