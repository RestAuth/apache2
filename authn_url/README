INSTALLATION:
copy the directory (authn_url) into the apache sources' modules/ directory.
then add authn_url to the SUBDIRS variable in modules/NWGNUMakefile:

SUBIRS = \
         authn_url \
         aaa \

finally, in the apache sources' main directory, do:

./buildconf
./configure --enable-authn-url
make
make install
